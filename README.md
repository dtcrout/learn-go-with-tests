# Learn Go with Tests

This is my own personal repository for the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) tutorial for learning Golang.

## Chapters

### Fundamentals

* Hello, World ✅
* Integers ✅
* Iteration ✅
* Arrays and slices ✅
* Structs, methods & interfaces
* Pointers & errors
* Maps
* Dependency Injection
* Mocking
* Concurrency
* Select
* Reflection
* Sync
* Context
* Intro to property based tests
* Maths

### Build an Application

* Intro
* HTTP server
* JSON, routing and embedding
* IO and sorting
* Command line & package structure
* Time
* WebSockets

## Notes

* Golang docs are available locally and can be launched via `$ godoc -http :8000**
* Having too many tests can become a problem in the long run; every test has its cost. Therefore the goal is not to have as many tests as possible, rather to have confidence in your codebase
* Interfaces allow you to make functions that can be used with different types
